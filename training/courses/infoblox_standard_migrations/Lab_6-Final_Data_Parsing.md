# Lab 6: Go-Live final Data Parsing, Migration and Validation
## Task 1: Data Parsing and Analysis - Lab Testing

The customer has provided a fresh data extraction so this time process the files in “Lab-6-
bloxcorp_dns_dhcp_datasets” dataset.

Using the DIW, Infoblox Grid and Grid CSV Export.
### Migrate the Data Set for Lab 6
- What if any errors do you see?



- Is any data being dropped?
- If so, can we drop it safely or do we need to resolve the issues?
- Do we need a follow-up call with the customer?
- Document your process for repeatability.

## Task 2: Data Validation
Based on the Migration in Task 1:

Do the following objects validate correctly?
- Zones
- Records
- Networks
- Ranges
- Fixed-address

### How did you determine this?

### Are there expected differences?

### Are there any concerns after validation?

### After import, what host (FQDN) has the IP Address 10.45.45.45?

## Task 3: Document the complete go-live process
Document the go-live process including both tasks for Partner/Infoblox and tasks for legacy systems
teams.

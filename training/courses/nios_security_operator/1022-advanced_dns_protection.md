# 1022: NIOS Advanced DNS Protection (ADP) Monitoring and Reporting

## 1022-01: Accessing ADP Logs

### Controlling ADP Logging
- ADP continuously tracking when rules are triggered
- When a rule is triggered, ADP can be configured to log  this event
- ADP supports logging via: syslog, SNMP traps, Infoblox Reporting Server

### Events Per Second
- ADP does not write to syslog every time a rule is hit/events is triggered
- Events per second value controls logging of events to syslog and SNMP
    * 0 = no logging
    * \>0 = log up to n per second
    * 1 is default
    * Setting events/sec to high value can overload syslog
    * IB recommends increasing only for rules that require investigation

### ADP Syslog Messages
- Administration > Logs > Syslog
- Select Grid Member, Quick Filter: \[S\] - Threat Detection Events
- CEF format, same format as DNS Firewall
- Timestamp, severity, facility, process
- CEF Severities:
    * 8 - Critical
    * 7 - Major
    * 6 - Warning
    * 4 - Informational

### Configuring SNMP Traps
- Grid Properties (Basic) > SNMP
    * Enable SNMPv1/v2 Traps
        * Check + community string
    * Enable SNMPv3 Traps
    * Trap Receivers
        * Address, SNMPv3 User, Comment
- Grid Properties (Adv) > SNMP Threshold

|               | Trigger (evts/sec) | Reset (evts/sec) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Flood Threats |                    |                  |
| Alert Rate    | 1 (default?)       | 0 (default?)     |
| Drop Rate     | 1 (default?)       | 0 (default?)     |


## 1022-02: NIOS ADP Dashboards

Dashboards > Status > Security
- Security will be an option if any security products are licensed
- Does not require Reporting Server
- Security Status for Grid
- Security Status for All Members

Threat Protection Status for the Grid widget
- Total events  by severity
- Top 10 grid members
- Events over time
- Top 10 Rules
- Top 10 Clients

Threat Protection Status for Members widget
- Monitor a single ADP appliance
- Same graphs as Threat Protection Status for the Grid, plus:
    * Traffic Usage Summary
    * Interface Usage Chart


## 1022-03: Reporting Server ADP Dashboards and Reports

### Reporting Server Indexes
- Confirm index categories:
    * DNS Query
    * DNS Performance
    * Security
    * System Capacity
    * System Utilization
- Confirm Reporting Service status
    * On Reporting Server member and ADP members

Reporting Server does NOT provide real-time view
- ADP appliances gather stats & logs, send to Reporting Server periodically
- Reporting Server indexes
- Data could be up to 15 minutes old
